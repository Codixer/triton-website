    Why Triton?
  </span>
  <p>
    Do you own an international Minecraft server? Would you like to send each player, messages in their own language?
    <br />
    Well, look no further! Triton offers this among a whole host of other awesome features! This plugin uses a placeholder which will be replaced (dynamically, per player) with a message defined in the language file.
  </p>
  <p>
    Triton works with any plugin
    <sup>
      1
    </sup>
     that allows customization of messages.
  </p>
  <span
    className="mdc-typography--caption"

    We don't promise it to work with literally all plugins, but most of them should work.
